  "We are Dominion City!!!",
  "Dominion City Canary Wharf is a model church dedicated to raising and transforming lives in Canary Wharf and its surrounding environs. We are a thriving community of 5,000 members who are well-grounded priests and kings, rooted in deep spiritual growth and worship. From our 10,000-seat multi-complex in the heart of the city, we equip our members - babies, young and old to excel in their divine calling—balancing a life of the Spirit with a commitment to leadership and societal impact.",
  "From this base, we carry a clear mandate to impact 10,000,000 (ten million) people for Christ across the United Kingdom. By bridging the altar and the marketplace, we raise kingdom-minded leaders and priests who use their influence and resources to serve others, fund the gospel, and establish God's dominion in every area of society.",
